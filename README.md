HbnContainer 2.0
================

[HbnContainer](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/hbncontainer) is a data connector for [Vaadin](http://vaadin.com) based on the popular [Hibernate ORM from JBoss](http://www.hibernate.org/). It is distributed as a Vaadin Add-on and it is used for binding entities with database records to feed components like  tables, forms and trees. It has remained in the top 10 most downloaded data components from the [Vaadin Add-on Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory) for a long time.

HbnContainer originated with Matti Tahvonen at Vaadin who created it for an article explaining how to use Hibernate with Vaadin. I took over as maintainer in 2011 when Matti found that he didn't have time to maintain this project along with all the other work he was doing for Vaadin and for the open source community. Matti continues to advise and consult on this project occasionally, as needed.

If you would like to use HbnContainer in your project please download it from the [HbnContainer Page in the Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory#addon/hbncontainer). You will find all release jars available at that location. If you want to use it with Vaadin 6 you will need v1.x, if you want to use it with Vaadin 7 you will need v2.x.
